# sdev200-fall2022
After a couple years of teaching software development courses it finally dawned on me that GitHub would be an excellent place to store the classroom examples, especially since the students in many of my classes will have to submit their projects via a repository, might as well get plenty of practice with it.


While I encourage students to check out different IDE's at this level, for class examples a we will be using Apache Netbeans for most of the Java coding, along with XAMPP to provide some local server functionality so that we can cover GUI's using .jsp pages (web apps seem more appropriate these days than desktop applications) with the ready to go Tomcat server, and the MariaDB for when we cover JDBC.


((the class lectures will be recorded, a link to the YouTube playlist will be placed here once it exists))
